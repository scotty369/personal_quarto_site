Hi there! My name is Scott Townsend, and I'm a senior majoring in Data Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. Currently, I'm working on my Senior Data Science Project, which has been an exciting and challenging journey.

Through this blog, I’ll be sharing updates on my project as I progress, along with insights, findings, and any hurdles I encounter along the way. I'll also showcase other data science projects I’ve completed, as well as those I'm actively working on, ranging from statistical analyses to machine learning applications.

Stay tuned for a deep dive into the world of data science, as I explore innovative ways to analyze, visualize, and interpret data!
